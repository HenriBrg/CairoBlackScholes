# Cairo Black-Scholes Library

[Local Dev only]

Black-Scholes library implemented as a Cairo smart contract
(```black_scholes_contract.cairo```). The address of the contract on the goerli
testnet is: ```0x044a7311f4dec0bd09ae59e2fc5d8ab6967cc32bd1e4dd3b4538f1d65450a36e```. See on voyager [here](https://goerli.voyager.online/contract/0x044a7311f4dec0bd09ae59e2fc5d8ab6967cc32bd1e4dd3b4538f1d65450a36e#readContract).

No un-whitelisted hints were used; functions like ```ln``` and ```exp``` are
implemented with numerical approximations in native Cairo. All inputs, outputs, and internal calculations use **27-digit fixed-point numbers**.

Example usage of contract:
```
Inputs are:
t_annualised = 1000000000000000000000000000 (1 year)
volatility = 150000000000000000000000000 (15%)
spot price = 300000000000000000000000000000 ($300)
strike price = 250000000000000000000000000000 ($250)
interest rate = 30000000000000000000000000 (3%)

Option price calculation:
starknet call --address 0x044a7311f4dec0bd09ae59e2fc5d8ab6967cc32bd1e4dd3b4538f1d65450a36e --abi black_scholes_contract_abi.json  --function option_prices --inputs 1000000000000000000000000000 150000000000000000000000000 300000000000000000000000000000 250000000000000000000000000000 30000000000000000000000000

Results are (call price = $58.82, put price = $1.43):
0xbe0e94e51c07da31bc68edb7 0x49fd4a0ba906e391f8e8589

Delta calculation:
starknet call --address 0x044a7311f4dec0bd09ae59e2fc5d8ab6967cc32bd1e4dd3b4538f1d65450a36e --abi black_scholes_contract_abi.json  --function delta --inputs 1000000000000000000000000000 150000000000000000000000000 300000000000000000000000000000 250000000000000000000000000000 30000000000000000000000000

Results are (call delta = 0.932, put delta = -0.068):
0x302e63a1bd2e76d922c0000 -0x38480283fd98cf55d40000
```

## Library

This library implements the interface described
[here](https://blog.lyra.finance/cairo-developer-grant/). The external functions
exposed allow you to retrieve the Black-Scholes call and put option prices and
the option greeks, given the expiration time, volatility, spot price,
strike price, and interest rate.

## Validation

The pytest deploys the smart contract in a local test environment and queries
for the call and put option prices with randomly generated test inputs.
Each test input consists of
(expiration time, volatility, spot price, strike price, interest rate).

The results are compared against the options prices as computed by the
[py\_vollib](https://github.com/vollib/py_vollib) library. The test validates
that the error from the Cairo library and the py\_vollib libary is minimal.
Option greeks were validated against online tools such as [this
one](https://goodcalculators.com/black-scholes-calculator/).

### Test Instructions

1. First make sure you can run a basic StarkNet contract unit test (see
   [here](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/unit_tests.html)).
2. Install py\_vollib: ```pip install py_vollib```.
3. Make sure you're using Cairo v0.7.0 or later.
4. Clone this repo and run ```pytest --capture=no black_scholes_test.py```.
